# Modelling the Model
## Overview
- In this activity, we will be creating the model class for our Ledger Project (Transaction.java)

## Instructions:
- Begin by cloning the starter code from the GitLab URL, as provided by your instructional staff, and import the project into IntelliJ.
- Under "../src/main/java/com.example.accessingdatamysql", create a new class named Transaction.java
- Add the following private members to the Transaction class:
	- id - Integer
	- sender - String
	- recipient - String
	- soft_delete - Boolean
	- transaction_value - Double
- Create a getter and setter method for each private member. Not all of these methods will be used in the Ledger Project, but you may choose to use these in the future for further enhancements
